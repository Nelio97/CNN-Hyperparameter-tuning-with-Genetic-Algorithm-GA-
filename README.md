# CNN-Hyperparameter-tuning-with-Genetic-Algorithm-GA-

This repository contains some files created during my BSc internship, which took place in the summer of 2019.

For 10 weeks, this was my first attempt to develop skills in a really interesting subject. I'm fully aware that the code is FAR FROM PERFECT, but I've really enjoyed the learning process!

The basis for the Genetic Algorithm was based on the one found in the following website https://towardsdatascience.com/genetic-algorithm-implementation-in-python-5ab67bb124a6 . Just want to thank Ahmed Gad for the beautifully straightforward explanation of a genetic algorithm.
 
This internship was my final course on BSc in Biomedical and Biophysical Engineering (FCUL - Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa), and took place in IBEB (Instituto de Biofísica e Engenharia Biomédica).
